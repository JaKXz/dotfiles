dotfiles starter template - compatible with MacOS and Spin.

- starting point - be productive now, and add/subtract what you care about
- updatable, with customization hooks - hack on it without breaking upgrades (compile step for configs?)
- clearly documented, highly commented for dotfiles 
- zsh scripting only - no additional dependencies
- antigen for ease of plugin use/themes (staples as default theme)
- set up git remote for pulling updates
